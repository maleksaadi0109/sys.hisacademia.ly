# Receipt System Integration Guide

## Overview
The receipt system has been successfully integrated into your booking form. When a user clicks "Save" and the payment is confirmed, a professional receipt is automatically generated and displayed.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Receipt Template
- **File**: `resources/views/pdf_export/receipt.blade.php`
- **Description**: Professional, printable receipt with modern design
- **Features**: 
  - Responsive design
  - Print-optimized layout
  - Auto-print functionality
  - PDF download option
  - Company logo placeholder

### 2. Controller Updates
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/DataEntry/DataEntryController.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `savebooking()` method to generate receipt data
  - Added `showReceipt()` method to display receipt
  - Added `translateBookingType()` helper method

### 3. Routes
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- **Added**: Receipt route for data_entry users

## How It Works

1. User fills out booking form and clicks "Save"
2. Form is validated and booking is saved to database
3. Receipt data is generated and stored in session
4. User is redirected to receipt page
5. Receipt automatically opens print dialog
6. User can print or download as PDF

## Receipt Data Included

- ✅ Company logo (placeholder ready)
- ✅ Customer name
- ✅ Amount paid
- ✅ Payment method (default: "نقدي")
- ✅ Date and time of payment
- ✅ Unique receipt number (format: RCP-000001)
- ✅ Booking details (type, space, dates)
- ✅ Payment status

## Company Logo Integration

To add your company logo:

1. **Upload the logo file** to `public/images/` directory
2. **Update the controller** in `DataEntryController.php`:

```php
// In the savebooking() method, update this line:
'companyLogo' => asset('images/your-logo.png'), // Replace with your logo path
```

3. **The logo will automatically appear** in the receipt header

## Customization Options

### Payment Method
Currently defaults to "نقدي" (Cash). To customize:

```php
// In savebooking() method, update:
'paymentMethod' => $request->input('payment_method', 'نقدي'),
```

### Company Information
Update in the receipt template:

```php
// In receipt.blade.php, update:
<div class="company-name">Your Company Name</div>
<div class="company-tagline">Your Company Tagline</div>
```

### Receipt Number Format
Change the format in `savebooking()` method:

```php
'receiptNumber' => 'YOUR-PREFIX-' . str_pad($booking->id, 6, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT),
```

## Testing

To test the receipt system:

1. Go to the booking form
2. Fill out all required fields
3. Click "Save"
4. You should be redirected to the receipt page
5. The print dialog should automatically open

## Security Notes

- Receipt route is protected by data_entry role middleware
- No sensitive data is exposed in URLs

## Future Enhancements

- Email receipt to customer
- Multiple payment methods
- Receipt templates selection
- Receipt history tracking
- Integration with accounting systems
